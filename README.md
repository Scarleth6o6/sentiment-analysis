# Text Classification Project
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a text classification model using machine learning techniques to categorize text data into predefined classes. The objective of this model is to accurately classify text inputs, leveraging various pre-processing, feature extraction, and model training steps.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to create a robust text classification system that can categorize textual data into specific categories. This model can be applied to various industries and tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or categorizing news articles.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a labeled set of text data, where each text sample is associated with a category label. This data is pre-processed and split into training and testing datasets.

## Methodology
1.- Data Pre-processing:
Tokenization: Splitting the text into words or tokens.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words that don’t contribute meaningful information.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form.
2.- Feature Extraction:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Converts the text data into numerical features that reflect the importance of terms in the dataset.
3.- Modeling:
A variety of machine learning algorithms were tested, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests. The best performing model was selected for further optimization.
4.- Evaluation:
The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
## Installation
1.- Clone the repository:
bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-classification-project.git
2.- Navigate into the project folder:
``` bash
cd text-classification-project
```
3.- Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:
``` bash
python train_model.py
```
This will train the model on the provided dataset and output evaluation metrics. You can also modify the script to test the model on new text data.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify text accurately. Further optimizations, such as hyperparameter tuning, could improve the model’s performance.

## Future Work
Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better performance.
Improve data preprocessing techniques to handle noisy text data.
Extend the model to handle multilingual text classification.
